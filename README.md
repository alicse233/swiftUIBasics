# SwiftUI Basics Components and Weather App UI Practice

This is a small practice project where I am learning the **basics of SwiftUI** by building a simple Weather UI and more UI components with basic views in SwiftUI.  
The goal is to explore layout, styling, and state management in SwiftUI while recreating a weather app interface.

## Features
- Built with **SwiftUI**
- Practice with **layouts** (VStack, HStack, ZStack)
- Custom **styling** (colors, gradients, fonts)
- Dynamic **state updates** (e.g., changing between day/night mode)
- Simple reusable **components** for weather cards

## Requirements
- Xcode (latest version recommended)
- iOS 15.0+
- Swift 5+
